# Hyphal Network: Apex-Hypha interactions

This github repository is linked to the article *'Direct Evidence of Apex–Hypha Interactions During Vegetative Growth of Fungal Thallus via Comprehensive Network and Trajectory Extraction'*.

The aim of this repository is to bring together the code (in Python 3) and files needed to analyse the interactions between apices and hyphae within the mycelial network of *Podospora anserina*.

This repository contains 2 python code files and an _Experiments_ folder containing the Network” objects corresponding to the different experiments analysed.
The first python code, named «Reseau.py» contain the definition of the Reseau and Branche classes previously described [in](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349524040633) *"Full identification of a growing and branching network's spatio-temporal structures"*, T. Chassereau, F. Chapeland-Leclerc et E. Herbert, 2025, DOI:10.1016/j.bpj.2024.12.002
The second python code, named "ApexHyphaInteractions.ipynb" contain the new analysis made here.
