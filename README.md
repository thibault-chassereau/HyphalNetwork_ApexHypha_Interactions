# Hyphal Network: Apex-Hypha interactions

This github repository is linked to the article *'Direct Evidence of Apex–Hypha Interactions During Vegetative Growth of Fungal Thallus via Comprehensive Network and Trajectory Extraction'*.

The aim of this repository is to bring together the code (in Python 3) and files needed to analyse the interactions between apices and hyphae within the mycelial network of *Podospora anserina*.

This repository contains 2 python code files and an “Experiments” folder containing the “Network” objects corresponding to the different experiments analysed.
The first python code, named "Reseau.py" contain the definition of the Reseau and Branche classes previously described in *"Full identification of a growing and branching network's spatio-temporal structures"*, T. Chassereau, F. Chapeland-Leclerc et E. Herbert, 2025
The second python code, named "ApexHyphaInteractions.ipynb" contain the new analysis made here.
